== PROJECT: Deadline Manager

---

== Overview

Deadline Manager is a tool written for students in NUS School of Computing to better manage their deadlines and priorities. Interacting through a Command Line Interface (CLI), users can easily manage their schedules and focus on what is most important to them.

Written in Java, Deadline Manager builds upon AddressBook - Level 4, a code base originally designed to teach Software Engineering principles. For more information and to take our project for a test run, please visit our home page [https://cs2103-ay1819s1-w17-4.github.io/main[on GitHub]].

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to import/export Deadline Manager*
** What it does: allows users to export a selection/subset of tasks to a file. This file can be shared with friends, who can then import it to their own Deadline Manager. Furthermore, users can export their tasks as Comma Separated Values (CSV) format, which is compatible with other major Calendar applications. This enables users to switch seamlessly to various services such as Google Calendar.
** Justification: This feature is essential to our Deadline Manager. Our Deadline Manager caters specifically to the study environment in School of Computing. As most assignments/deadlines are common to the entire module, the ability to import/export tasks allows students to share and remind each other of their schedules. Furthermore, through import/export, professors can also make use of Deadline Manager to update and remind students of upcoming assessments. The ability to export as CSV format further improves the user experience, as users can switch seamlessly to other major Calendar services such as Google Calendar.
** Highlights: //TO-DO. Talk abt import resolver
** Credits: Referenced https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37118?hl=en[CSV format compatible with Google Calendar] to understand the specifications for exporting in CSV format.

* *Minor enhancement*: changed how parameters are parsed by the app.
** What it does: Previously, the app ignores repeated parameters (e.g. specify `name` more than once), which can be confusing for the user. Made changes to the parser so that an appropriate error will be thrown instead.
